# video-file-player
Simple HTML video player that plays local files on your computer with browser extensions enabled.

I mostly use this to watch local video files with the ability to speed up or slow down the playback with the [Video Speed Controller](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?pli=1) Chrome Extension
